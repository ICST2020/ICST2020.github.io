# Q: Why Double­Blind?

There are many reasons for this decision but in short we think that current
evidence points to it being the most ethical and professional thing to do: it
can reduce bias against gender, less well-known individuals, groups,
universities, etc. and the “costs” for its implementation are relatively low.
For those who are interested in further motivations for double blind reviewing,
a very well­ argued, referenced and evidenced article in favour of double blind
review processes for Software Engineering conferences can be found in [the blog
post by Claire Le Goues](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~clegoues/double-blind.html){:target="_blank"}.
And here is [a list of double-blind
resources](http://www.robertfeldt.net/advice/double_blind_reviewing/){:target="_blank"} from
Robert Feldt. And [a more formal study of the
subject](https://peerj.com/preprints/1757/){:target="_blank"} by Moritz Beller​​ and Alberto
Bacchelli​​.

# Q: How to prepare your ICST2020 submission for double-­blind reviewing?

In order to comply, you do not have to make your identity undiscoverable; the
double­-blind aspect of the review process is not an adversarial identity
discovery process. Essentially, the guiding principle should be to maximize the
number of people who could plausibly be authors, subject to the constraint that
no change is made to any technical details of the work. Therefore, you should
ensure that the reviewers are able to read and review your paper without having
to know who any of the authors are. Specifically, this involves at least the
following four points:

Omitting all authors’ names, affiliations, emails and related information from
the title page as well as in the paper itself.

Referring to your own work in the third person. You should not change the names
of your own tools, approaches or systems, since this would clearly compromise
the review process. It breaks the constraint that “no change is made to any
technical details of the work”. However, you should always refer to the
authorship/provenance of tools, approaches or systems in the third person, so
that it is credible that another author could have written your paper.

Not relying on supplementary material (your web site, GitHub repository,
YouTube channel) in the paper. Supplementary information might result in
revealing author identities.

Anonymize project and grant names and numbers or those of funding agencies or
countries as well as any acknowledgments of support to the work you report on.

We further expect you to follow the excellent advice on anonymization from ACM:
https://icer.hosting.acm.org/icer-2017/additional-advice-on-anonymization/

When anonymizing your email, affiliations, name etc. try to refrain from being
overly creative or “funny” by coming up with your own, anonymized versions. For
emails preferably use author1@anon.org, author2@anon.org, etc. since initial
DBR screening will be done by an automated tool.

# Q: I previously published an earlier version of this work in a venue that doesn’t have double-blind. What should I do about acknowledging that previous work?

Double-blind does not and cannot mean that it’s impossible for the referees to
discover the identity of the author. However, we require authors to help make
it easy for author identity to not play a role in the reviewing process.
Therefore, we ask that in the materials you submit to us to be reviewed author
identity is not revealed.

If the work you are submitting for review has previously been published in a
non-peer-reviewed venue (e.g., arXiv departmental tech report), there is no
need to cite it, because unrefereed work is not truly part of the scientific
literature. If the previous work is published in a peer-reviewed venue, then it
should be cited, but in the third person so that it is not clear whether or not
this work was done by the author of the submitted paper or some other set of
authors unknown. However, if citing in the third person would still risk that
it is easy to identify the authors please err on the side of caution by also
anonymising the papers being extended (both when cited and in the reference
list).

# Q: Our submission makes use of work from a PhD/master’s thesis dissertation/report which has been published. Citing the dissertation might compromise anonymity. What should we do?

It’s perfectly OK to publish work from a PhD/master’s thesis, and there’s no
need to cite it in the version submitted for review because prior dissertation
publication does not compromise novelty. In the final (post-review, camera
ready) version of the paper, please do cite the dissertation to acknowledge its
contribution, but in the refereed version of the paper that you submit, please
refrain from citing the dissertation.

However, you need not worry whether or not the dissertation has appeared, since
your job is only to help the committee review your work without awareness of
author identity, but not to make it impossible for them to discover the
identity of authors. The referees will be trying hard not to discover the
authors’ identity, so they will likely not be searching the web to check
whether there is a dissertation related to this work.

# Q: I’m submitting to the industry track. Should i double-blind my submission?

No you should not. Since industry papers typically relies heavily on the
industrial/practical context in which the work was carried out it would be too
much to ask to require this context to be anonymized.

# Q: I want to include a link to an online appendix in my submission. How should I do this?

Ideally the information in the appendix should be anonymous and it should be
uploaded to an anonymous service such as for example
[figshare](https://figshare.com){:target="_blank"}. These sites will give you a link that is
anonymous. Later, if the paper is accepted you can turn that link into a
non-anonymized link or just put the appendix on your own site and change the
link in the camera ready version of the paper. An alternative solution is to
not include the link in the submission; normally papers should be possible to
review based on only the material of the paper itself.

To upload material on [figshare](https://figshare.com){:target="_blank"} please create an account
there, then add a new item, use the keywords “Supplemental Materials” and add
the other item-specific data and then select “Make file(s) confidential” and
select “Generate private link”. Copy the url generated there and then “Save
changes”. Your file(s) can now be accessed anonymously at the given url so you
can put it in your ICST submission.
