ICST 2020 invites high quality submissions in all areas of software testing, verification, and validation. Papers for the research track should present novel and original work that advances the state-of-the-art. Case studies and empirical research papers are also welcome.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but is not limited to, the following:
- Fuzz testing
- Manual testing practices and techniques
- Search based software testing
- Security testing
- Model based testing
- Test automation
- Static analysis and symbolic execution
- Formal verification and Model checking
- Software reliability
- Testability and design
- Testing and development processes
- Testing education
- Testing in specific domains, such as mobile, web, embedded, concurrent, distributed, cloud, GUI and real-time systems
- Testing for learning-enabled software, including deep learning
- Testing/debugging tools
- Theory of software testing
- Empirical studies
- Experience reports

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the ICST Program Committee.

Papers that have a strong industrial/practical component and focus more on impact rather than (technical) novelty are encouraged to consider the industry track instead.

## Submission Format

Full Research Papers as well as Industry papers must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format. Templates for LaTeX and Microsoft Word are available from [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html): please use the letter format template and conference option.

Papers should be submitted in the PDF format: they must not exceed ten pages, plus up to two pages of references. Submissions will be handled via EasyChair.

Papers must neither have been previously accepted for publication nor be under submission in another conference or journal. The ICST 2020 research track accepts only full research papers. Short papers are not accepted to the research track.

For your paper to be published in the ICST 2020 conference proceedings, at least one of the authors of the paper must register for the conference and confirm that she/he will present the paper in person.

**New in 2020.**  Submissions must supply all information that is needed to replicate the results, and therefore are expected to include or point to a replication package with the necessary software, data, and instructions.  Reviewers may consult these packages to resolve open issues.  There can be good reasons for the absence of a replication package, such as confidential code and/or data, the research being mostly qualitative, or the paper being fully self-contained.  If a paper does not come with a replication package, authors should comment on its absence in the submission data; reviewers will take such comments into account.
