In the past few years, ICST has established sponsorship
with different companies. Some companies provided scholarships for attendees.
As a Corporate sponsor, you will enjoy high visibility to a large community of
scientists and highly qualified industrial practitioners. Your organization’s
logo will be printed on all ICST publicity materials, and we will also provide
various opportunities to provide corporate information to attendees. For higher
sponsorship levels, we are open to negotiations regarding special benefits
tailored to the needs and interests of your organization.

We have a five-level corporate sponsoring scheme for ICST 2020: Diamond,
Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze. Benefits and prices are listed in the table
on the next page. Depending on the actual sponsorship level, additional
benefits may be negotiated. Sponsorship can also be associated with a specific
conference activity, for example the conference dinner, industry-academia
tutorials, or for ensuring live video coverage of the conference.
